    <p>
        <br>Oriental Mindoro's rich and arable land is suitable 
        for agriculture. It produces large quantities of rice, 
        corn, coconut, vegetables and fruits like calamansi, 
        banana, rambutan, marang or uloy, lanzones and durian. 
        For that, Oriental Mindoro is also known as the Rice 
        Granary and Fruit Basket of Southern Tagalog.

        <h3>HISTORY</h3>
        <br>Mindoro is an island made up of two contiguous provinces of Oriental Mindoro and Occidental Mindoro. It is the seventh largest in the Philippines and has a total area of 20,244.51 sq. kilometers. 5,879.85 sq. km. correspond to the area covered by Oriental Mindoro. It lies southwest of Luzon and north of the main Visayan group of Islands.

        Calapan City, the capital of Oriental Mindoro, is forty five kilometers south of Batangas and 130 kms from Manila.
        
        The municipalities in the province are: Puerto Galera, San Teodoro, Baco, Naujan, Victoria, Socorro, Pola, Pinamalayan, Gloria, Bansud, Bongabong, Roxas, Mansalay and Bulalacao.
        
        The province is bounded on the north by the Verde Island Passage, on the east by Tablas Strait and in the south by Semirara Island. The Western part of the Island is the province of Occidental Mindoro. Providing the natural dividing barrier between the two provinces is the vast jungle-capped mountain ranges that stretch from north to south with the majestic Mt. Halcon towering at 2,586 meters followed by Mt.Baco at 2,215 meters.
        
        Oriental Mindoro has a total of 126 islands and islets, 38 of which are named. Numerous rivers and streams traverse the country sides. There are several inland bodies of water in the province. The most well-known is the Naujan Lake National Park, the fish habitat of the famous DABALISTIHIT (Dalag, Bangus, Banglis, Tilapia, and Hito). Another tributary that is gaining popularity is the Caluangan Lake in Calapan. It is actually the widest portion of Baruyan River, it is the home of the succulent baroy and silipis molusk.
        
        The hinterland of Mindoro is settled by the aboriginal tribesmen collectively known as the Mangyans. These indigenous peoples according to anthropologists, are the earliest inhabitants of the Island dating back to the Pleistocene period. They are classified into seven ethnolinguistic groups: Iraya, Alangan, Tadyawan, Buhid, Taubuid, Hanunuo and Bangon. The Hanunuos, who live in the southern mountains of Mansalay and Bulalacao, have retained the Ambahan (ancient script) and syllabary that bears Indo-Malay influence
        
        Mindoreños are proud of the fact that there are three things that cannot be found anywhere else in the world except in Mindoro: the peace-loving indigenous Mangyans, the towering majestic Mt. Halcon, and the Tamaraw (bubalus mindorensis), a species of wild buffalo now facing extinction. These three gems of Mindoro compose an acronym based on the first syllables of their names – MAHALTA. The greeting MAHALTA is now used to describe everything that is good in Mindoro – Welcome, Goodbye and Godspeed.
